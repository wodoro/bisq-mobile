/**
 * Receives FCM messages and forwards new tokens to the facade.

 * Decryption mirrors the iOS NSE
 * (`iosClient/BisqNotificationService/NotificationService.swift`):
 *
 * - The relay pushes a data-only FCM message with `data["encrypted"]` carrying
 *   a Base64 string of `nonce(12) || ciphertext || tag(16)`.
 * - We decrypt with AES-256-GCM using the per-device symmetric key, sealed at
 *   rest with an AndroidKeyStore key (see `PushNotificationKey.android.kt`).
 * - The banner names the counterparty but never quotes the message. That is the same line
 *   the local path draws (`PrivateChatNotificationService`, `OpenTradesNotificationService`),
 *   which [PushNotification] deliberately matches. `payload.message` carries the chat message
 *   body and is never displayed. Same posture as the iOS NSE, which redacts on the lock screen
 *   through the category's `hiddenPreviewsBodyPlaceholder` instead of [AndroidLockScreenPolicy].
